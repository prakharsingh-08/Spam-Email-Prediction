# Spam Email Prediction

This project’s aim is to implement a spam mail detector by classifying incoming
mails as either ‘ham’ that is normal or non-spam mail or ‘spam’ mail.For this we have used
tow complex data sets along with different Models and Algorithm to check how accurately our model is being able to detect/classify the mails
as ham or spam mails by calculating the accuracies of the testing data and the training data obtained from the each data sets.

## Introduction

E-mail is an efficient mode of communication which saves money and time
which it a popular mode of communication in both personal and professional
communication. E-mail allows internet users to simply share information
throughout the world. However, there is a chance that your e-mails will be
affected by active or passive attacks.Spam emails are another category for emails.
Spam emails cause a variety of problems, including decreased email engine
efficiency, the use of unneeded mailbox space, and the instability of mail servers. It occasionally also includes malware, viruses, and other elements that could
endanger a particular user.


## Key Steps

1. Email Filtering - One of the primary methods for identifying spam mail is email filtering. Incoming emails must be categorized as spam or not. Machine learning
algorithms that recognize spam can be trained using the text and metadata of the
emails.
2. Text Classification: Text categorization is a supervised learning technique that
can be used to detect spam. It comprises identifying emails as spam or not spam
based on specified traits, such as the usage of specific phrases, tone, or language.
3. Feature engineering: It is the process of choosing pertinent features from an
email to categorize it as spam or not.


## Model Used 

- Naive Bayes Classifier : The Naive Bayes algorithm is a supervised learning technique which is based on
the Bayes theorem and used to resolve classification issues.The main application
of this algorithm is text classification with a large training set.

## Future Scopes

* Enhancing the existing spam filtering algorithms
* Integration of Multiple Data Sources.
* Real-time spam detection
* Mobile spam detection
