# Spam Email Prediction

This project’s aim is to implement a spam mail detector by classifying incoming
mails as either ‘ham’ that is normal or non-spam mail or ‘spam’ mail.For this we have used
tow complex data sets along with different Models and Algorithm to check how accurately our model is being able to detect/classify the mails
as ham or spam mails by calculating the accuracies of the testing data and the training data obtained from the each data sets.

# Key Steps

1. Email Filtering - One of the primary methods for identifying spam mail is email filtering. Incoming emails must be categorized as spam or not. Machine learning
algorithms that recognize spam can be trained using the text and metadata of the
emails.
2. Text Classification: Text categorization is a supervised learning technique that
can be used to detect spam. It comprises identifying emails as spam or not spam
based on specified traits, such as the usage of specific phrases, tone, or language.
3. Feature engineering: It is the process of choosing pertinent features from an
email to categorize it as spam or not.
